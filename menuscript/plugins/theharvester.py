        "Want a nosy little drone that quietly snoops the public web so you don't have to?\n\n"
        "theHarvester pulls together email addresses, subdomains, hostnames, and employee names from public sources (search engines, "
        "public DNS, certificate transparency, social media, and more) to give you a fast reconnaissance snapshot.\n\n"
        "It's perfect for building an external attack surface map and collecting leads before deeper testing â€” think of it as the "
        "first-pass for OSINT that points you where to probe next. theHarvester doesn't exploit anything; it aggregates publicly "
        "available artifacts so you can triage, add to the job log, and convert useful results into Findings.\n\n"
        "Play nice: gathering lots of public data can trigger rate limits or alerts on some services, so use respectful query rates "
        "and follow your engagement rules. ðŸ˜‡\n\n"
        "Quick tips:\n"
        "- Great for initial external recon: email harvesting, subdomain discovery, host collection, and employee name gathering.\n"
        "- Combine its output with DNS, CT logs, and certificate data for better coverage.\n"
        "- Save results (CSV/JSON) to the job log so you can import them into Findings, asset lists, or follow-up scans.\n"
        "- Respect rate limits and API terms for the public sources you query.\n"
        "- Use findings from theHarvester to feed targeted scans (subdomain -> Nmap -> service checks) or social-engineering risk assessments.\n"
